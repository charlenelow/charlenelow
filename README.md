# About Me :point_down:
Hello there! I'm currently embarking on an exciting adventure as a self-taught data analyst. This platform serves as a space for me to document my progress and connect with fellow enthusiasts in the field. With a background in food technology, my journey into data analytics was triggered by my previous company's relocation. Driven by curiosity, my experience in food product development has honed my talent for extracting insights from data, involving consumer surveys and focus groups. To launch my data analytics journey, I enrolled in the 'Google Data Analytics Professional' course, and with each exploration of this subject, I find myself increasingly captivated. Properly cleaning, analyzing, and thoughtfully presenting raw data reveals hidden truths that often remain obscured among numbers and figures.
